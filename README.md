# ML_OIL_SPILL
Machine Learning Project on Oil Spill Dataset
In this Project of Machine Learning I have worked on Oil Spill dataset, where I took all the necessary steps of data preprocessing like cleaning of the data and scaling of the data. 
I tried various Machine Learning model such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree to train and test my data and choose the best model which gave the highest Accuracy Score. Later saved the model and used it on random data that was picked from the original data.
